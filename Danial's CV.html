  <h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
  <hr size=1 noshade>
  <p align="justify">I am a confident and motivated person who endeavours for the best in everything I do. I am a determined individual with a can-do attitude that means I work well under pressure and can be relied upon to support my team whatever
    the circumstances. Worked in Fulton Hogan and working across Air New Zealand Airline Operation, Cargo and Safety applications, which provided me with a broad level of experience in application architecture, development, configuration and support.
    I have a strong desire to acquire knowledge and believe in continuous education to accomplish my career goals.</p>
